# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I want to transition from IT helpdesk to SWE! I built this project to gain hands on coding experience. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript to customize/build a web page.

## Installation

## Usage

I will use this study guide as a refresher/guide going forward. It covers the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, so I'll need to continue to refer back to this study guide until it is cemented in my head.

## Credits

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
